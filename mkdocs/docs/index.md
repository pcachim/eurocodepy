This site contains the project documentation for the
[eurocodepy](https://github.com/pcachim/eurocodepy) project that is a python package for using Eurocodes.
Its aim is to give you a framework to build your
project documentation using Python, MkDocs,
mkdocstrings, and the Material for MkDocs theme.

Eurocodepy are Python functions to work with structural eurocodes. Material data is stored in a JSON file. Current materials in the database are:

urrent materials in the database are:

* concrete (C20 to C90)
* timber (C, D, GL)
* reinforcement (B400, B500, A400, A500)
* structural steel (S235, S275, S355, S450)

Available european steel profiles are:

* IPE
* HEA
* HEB
* HEM
* L
* C
* T
* Pipe
* Box
* Double L
* Double C

There are also some functions to work with material properties:

* creep_coef
* shrink_strain

The existing functions are listed in the page '[Reference](reference.md)'. They are divided by eurocode.

## Table Of Contents

The documentation follows the best practice for
project documentation as described by Daniele Procida
in the [Di√°taxis documentation framework](https://diataxis.fr/)
and consists of four separate parts:

1. [Tutorials](tutorials.md)
2. [How-To Guides](how-to-guides.md)
3. [Reference](reference.md)
4. [Explanation](explanation.md)
5. [License](copyright.md)

Quickly find what you're looking for depending on
your use case by looking at the different pages.
