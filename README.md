# eurocodepy

A Python library for structural design calculations according to the Eurocode standards, being mostly Python helpers for working with **Eurocodes** in a pragmatic, engineering-focused way: reusable calculations, common design utilities, and tidy abstractions you can drop into your own scripts and notebooks.

## What this project is

`eurocodepy` aims to provide small, composable building blocks that make it easier to:

- perform Eurocode-aligned calculations in Python
- standardize recurring formulas / factors / combinations
- keep design code in projects readable and testable

## Status

Early-stage / evolving. APIs may change as the library grows.

## Installation

You can install EurocodePy directly from PyPI using pip:

pip install eurocodepy
Or install the latest development version directly from the source repository:

pip install git+https://github.com/pcachim/eurocodepy.git
